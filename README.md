 Conceptual Design of an IIoT Sensor Network & Protocol Experimentation
 
## Project Overview
This project is a conceptual design of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensor network. It simulates sensor data collection using multiple communication protocols, including MQTT, CoAP, and OPC UA. The project enables real-time sensor data transmission and visualization, making it a valuable tool for understanding IIoT network operations.

## Installation Instructions
Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Step 3: Create a Virtual IIoT Environment with Multiple Protocols
Step 4: Subscribe to Sensor Data and Visualize

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies:
Communication Protocols: MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA
Programming Language: Python
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Networking: paho-mqtt, aiocoap, asyncua
Visualization: Matplotlib
