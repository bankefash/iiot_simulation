 Conceptual Design of an IIoT Sensor Network & Protocol Experimentation
 
# Project Overview
This project is a conceptual design of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensor network. It simulates sensor data collection using multiple communication protocols, including MQTT, CoAP, and OPC UA. The project enables real-time sensor data transmission and visualization, making it a valuable tool for understanding IIoT network operations.

# Installation Instructions
